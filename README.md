# Chatbot using NLP and Deep Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project is an AI-powered chatbot that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning to understand user queries and generate human-like responses. The chatbot can be used in applications like customer support, virtual assistants, education platforms, and more.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To build an intelligent and interactive chatbot capable of understanding and responding to user inputs in natural language using deep learning techniques.

## âœ… Features

* Conversational chatbot using NLP and deep learning models
* Preprocessing of user input (tokenization, stemming, lemmatization)
* Intent classification using neural networks
* Support for predefined intents and custom dataset
* Text-based interface (console or web UI)
* Memory-based or context-aware conversation (optional)

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Deep Learning Frameworks:** TensorFlow / PyTorch
* **NLP Tools:** NLTK, spaCy, Hugging Face Transformers
* **Model Type:** Seq2Seq (LSTM/GRU), Transformer, or BERT-based model
* **Web Integration (Optional):** Flask, Django, or Streamlit
* **Dataset:** Custom intents.json or public datasets (Cornell Movie Dialogs, etc.)



## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. **Input:** User types a message.
2. **Preprocessing:** Text is tokenized, stemmed/lemmatized.
3. **Intent Classification:** Deep learning model predicts the user's intent.
4. **Response Generation:** Bot selects the best response from the intent or generates new text (if generative model used).
5. **Output:** The response is displayed or spoken (via TTS).

## ðŸš€ Future Enhancements

* Add voice support (Speech-to-Text & Text-to-Speech)
* Use Transformer models like GPT/BERT for advanced conversations
* Contextual memory-based responses
* Deploy on cloud (AWS, Azure, Heroku)
* Multilingual conversations

## ðŸŒŸ Use Cases

* Customer Service Bots
* Virtual Assistants
* Educational Chatbots
* Healthcare Query Assistants
* E-commerce Product Support
